##### First we need to answer the question of what is an emulator?
Emulator is a software which is used to simulate (or emulate) hardware components using software. Now to build an emulator I will use python. Python is not the ideal language to make an emulator because of it's slow speed and also because other languages like C/C++ are more low  level languages and are therefore much better choices to build emulators. I will use python because I am more familiar with the language also emulation is a side project maybe after building this project I will try to do the same in C++.

##### Now How to actually build an emulator?
I am going to be building a [[CHIP-8]] emulator here.

To build an emulator for a CHIP-8 system we first need to learn the basics of computer architecture and to find out the different components we need to build. I have discussed about [[Computer Architecture]] here.
